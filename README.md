# Vannila Sctructure Project
This useful tool creates the directories for your amazing project.

## Using
To use this tool pass these arguments to the script (in that order):
- Language 
- Project Type


In this moment the supported languages are:
- Php 
- Go

And the project types are:
- Api

## Example:
`sh create.sh php api`

## Contribute to this Repo
Suggestions, issues and contributions are very welcome. :)

## What is missing?

- Make the docker functionality change the service name and the alias name in the docker-compose.
- Do other types of projects rather than just api.
- Make the php run the composer creating the vendor directoty and the namespaces work.
